        <h1>TradeWear</h1>
        <h2>Written Proposal and Concepts</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>TradeWear is a clothing exchange app my group and I created last semester in SMAD 317. The goal of this app was to create a platform for college students to interact and purchase or exchange clothing within the community. Students tend to have a surplus of clothing that they do not wear without a community-based platform they can use to do business with those nearby. We took financial unstability of college students into an account and created a prototype enabling students to purchase or sell their clothing for cheap. </p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>My goal for this project is to revise our personas used and include different challenges and motivations. Last semester, we created personas and all of our interviewees mentioned their awareness of environmental concerns of the fashion industry and financial problems. However, I believe more in-depth user research is necessary to learn how the app will function by the users, as well as to broaden our personas in terms of gender and their app usage ability. Another goal of mine is to revise our default effect. We implemented a location feature in which users can choose their location once they sign up for an app and direct their feed to the postings of that location. However, there is a possibility of excluding users by the location feature regardless of the app being a college community based platform. Therefore, I want to come up with a solution for users to be able to use the location feature and have control of their feed at the same time. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>As stated in the previous paragraph, our target audience is college students and those within an age range of 18-21. Since one of my goals is to revise the used personas, I will be conducting a more in-depth research of potential users and their skills, priorities, and behaviors. </p>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>First, I will work on the user research and personas. After that, I will use Adobe XD to revise the prototype including our default settings in order to make the app more inclusive and user-friendly. - I'm sorry I didn't really understand the Timeline portion- </p>
